Notes
 - Cannot use keyword Class to apply styles , this is reserved keyword for classes, use 'ClassName'.
 - Each component needs to return/ render some JSX code - it defines which HTML code React should render to the real DOM in the end.

Best Practices
 - There Should be always one rood element in each component
 - Capitalise the component name or folder names in the project.
 - use ES6/ES7 or Next gen javascript syntaxes goind forward in React.
 - When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:
        --Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more about this later in the course) =>
             const cmp = () => {
                  return <div>some JSX</div> 
                  } 
            (using ES6 arrow functions as shown here is recommended but optional)
        --class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) => 
             class Cmp extends Component 
             { 
                 render () 
                 { 
                     return <div>some JSX</div> 
                 } 
             }
    Use functional components as often as possible though. It's the best-practice.
